      <h3>DISC-test</h3>
      <div class="d-flex flex-column">
        <p> The DISC-test is supposed to give participants an insight into their own personality style, behaviour and way of communicating.
          To achieve this, behavioral characteristics are grouped in 4 styles: Dominant, Influence, Stable and Conscientious.</p>
        <canvas id="chart"></canvas>
        <p> My most dominant behavioral style is Conscientious, followed by Stable.
          With these results it is now possible to make an estimate of my strengths and weaknesses:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Strengths</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Usually satisfied and can adapt herself</li>
            <li>Not very combative</li>
            <li>More careful than impulsive, avoids risks</li>
            <li>Acts in a tactful, diplomatic way and strives for a stable and orderly life</li>
            <li>Is fine with working and living according to established procedures</li>
            <li>Patient, calm and self-possessed</li>
            <li>Very willing to help others - especially people who she regards as friends</li>
            <li>Analytical</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Rather lets others take the initiative or solve problems first</li>
            <li>Is less socially active</li>
            <li>Is less open to challenges</li>
            <li>Has more problems dealing with unexpected situations</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I can certainly agree with these results, both at school and in daily life I am rather a quiet person and I attach great importance to order and routine.
        The weak points are work points that I am aware of, especially the trouble to take initiative is very recognizable.
        In a team I therefore need a leader who can assign instructions. I also work easier towards deadlines.
        <br>
        I would not say that this test has taught me a lot, but it is certainly enriching to be able to list strengths and weaknesses in order to gain more insight into my personality.
        This test can also help with collaboration with others, such as the team passport that we had to compile for InnovIT.

      <h2>Enterprising and IT</h2>
      <h3>InnovIT</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this assignment was to come up with an innovative application related to one of 4 social themes (environment, safety, mobility and health).
        We expanded this concept further and further, resulting in mock-ups and a commercial that we used to pitch our idea at the InnovIT Awards. </p>
      <h4>Our idea</h4>
      <p>
        bEETer is an app made for people with a heart for mother nature who want to help the environment by purchasing local food.
        On one hand you can search for a product to receive a list of available traders who offer this product.
        These can be shops, but also local farms that grow and sell their own fruit and vegetables.
        On the other hand, the app can scan product barcodes and trace their origin.
        The full travel route of the product is shown to be able to grasp how far some products are transported.
        In addition, a local variant is recommended, with the nearest location where this can be obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal was to show that small changes in our buying behavior can have a major impact on the environment.
        The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted during transport is enormous, and also unnecessary when you see how many local alternatives can be found.
        We hope to find a smaller range of international products in the future, so that people are forced to live more environmentally conscious.
