      <h2>Munchkin</h2>
      <p>For the course Projects-Workshops I we were given the challenging task of implementing the card game Munchkin, both textually and graphically.
        This proved to be a more difficult task than expected, but in the end it was one of the most educational experiences I have had so far.
        By working out a complete program, including a database, starting from only use cases, I gained a lot of insight into the development process.
        Of course, there were sometimes unforeseen difficulties, which meant that I had to devise and try out various solution strategies.
        Of all courses, this was certainly the most difficult for me, but also the most useful.</p>
      <h3>What is Munchkin?</h3>
      <p>Munchkin is a card game that is the ultimate parody of Dungeons & Dragons.
        You start the game as a level one human.
        But during the game you can change to a dwarf, elf or halfling.
        Fight monsters, take the treasure and steal the treasure from your teammates.
        To achieve level ten and win the game, truly everything is allowed.
      </p>
      <h4>Gameplay</h4>
      <p>Open the door and see what is behind it: is it a monster or an object.
        If it's a monster, you can choose to fight with it. But make sure you can beat it, otherwise you will have to flee.
        If you make it, you get his treasure and you gain a level.
        If you are unable to defeat the monster, you can seek the help of your fellow players.
        But they don't help you for free and they can ask you to share the treasure.
        You can also increase the challenge by throwing potions, involving other monsters in the fight or making the monster that someone else is fighting stronger.
        Almost everything is allowed in Munchkin, as long as you make sure you win.
        The player who first reaches level ten wins the game.</p>
      <h3>Our implementation</h3>
